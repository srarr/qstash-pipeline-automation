# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated pipeline system that creates a complete development environment with QStash message queuing, Docker services, Vector database, GPU back-testing capabilities, and CI/CD scripts. The system is designed to process trading concepts through a distributed architecture using Cloudflare Workers, Scrapy crawlers, FastAPI orchestration, and GPU-accelerated validation, all deployable within approximately 15 minutes on an RTX 4080 system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated monorepo structure generator, so that I can quickly scaffold a complete project with proper devcontainer support and Docker composition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL create a monorepo structure with .devcontainer/, infra/, services/, tests/, and .github/workflows/ directories
2. WHEN devcontainer is configured THEN it SHALL support multi-service Docker composition with Python 3.11, Docker-in-Docker, and required VS Code extensions
3. WHEN Docker compose is generated THEN it SHALL include Redis, Weaviate, crawler, parser, orchestrator, and validator services with proper networking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want QStash producer/consumer integration, so that I can handle message queuing with delay, retry, and DLQ capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is published THEN the system SHALL use QStash API with proper authentication and delay headers
2. WHEN a webhook is received THEN the system SHALL verify JWT signatures using QSTASH_SIGNING_KEY
3. WHEN message processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff (10s, 30s, 60s)
4. WHEN maximum retries are exceeded THEN the system SHALL route messages to Dead Letter Queue
5. WHEN cron scheduling is configured THEN the system SHALL support cron expressions for periodic message publishing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Edge Worker deployment automation, so that I can deploy Cloudflare Workers with proper configuration and secret management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Edge Worker code is generated THEN it SHALL include concept-based search functionality and URL storage
2. WHEN deployment is triggered THEN the system SHALL use Wrangler CLI with proper secret configuration
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting and error responses appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated crawler and parser services, so that I can process web content with async operations and structured data output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN crawler runs THEN it SHALL use httpx.AsyncClient for non-blocking operations with Redis queue integration
2. WHEN content is parsed THEN it SHALL use Polars for data processing and SentenceTransformer for embeddings
3. WHEN data is output THEN it SHALL use Arrow IPC format with size constraints under 1MB
4. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and log appropriate messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GPU-accelerated back-testing capabilities, so that I can perform high-performance financial analysis using vectorbt and CUDA.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPU validation runs THEN the system SHALL detect and utilize RTX 4080 GPU capabilities
2. WHEN back-testing is performed THEN it SHALL use vectorbt with Numba/CUDA acceleration
3. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL save portfolio analysis in pickle format
4. WHEN GPU is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to CPU processing with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Vector database integration, so that I can store and query embeddings with Weaviate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Weaviate service starts THEN it SHALL be accessible on port 8080 with health check endpoint
2. WHEN data is ingested THEN the system SHALL batch process embeddings into Weaviate collections
3. WHEN queries are made THEN the system SHALL return relevant results with similarity scoring
4. WHEN service fails THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and reconnection logic

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and CI/CD pipeline, so that I can ensure code quality and automated deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests run THEN they SHALL cover QStash producer, parser schema validation, and GPU availability
2. WHEN integration tests execute THEN they SHALL verify end-to-end message flow and service communication
3. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN it SHALL execute linting, testing, and build verification on GitHub Actions
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent deployment

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment configuration management, so that I can securely handle API keys and service configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment is set up THEN the system SHALL require QSTASH_URL, QSTASH_TOKEN, and QSTASH_SIGNING_KEY
2. WHEN secrets are stored THEN they SHALL be excluded from version control via .gitignore
3. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL validate required environment variables and fail gracefully if missing
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without service restart

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want monitoring and observability features, so that I can track system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for all components
2. WHEN messages are processed THEN the system SHALL log throughput metrics and processing times
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information with context
4. WHEN rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement flow control at 500 requests per second

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated backup and recovery capabilities, so that I can protect data and ensure system resilience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup is scheduled THEN the system SHALL sync Weaviate data to R2 storage nightly
2. WHEN data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL support point-in-time recovery from backups
3. WHEN services fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic restart policies with exponential backoff
4. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL provide complete environment restoration procedures
